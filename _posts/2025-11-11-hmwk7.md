## Random Walk Interpretation

This problem can be seen as a **random walk** process, where each week corresponds to a step in one of two directions:

- **Upward step (+1):** the server remains secure.  
- **Downward step (−1):** at least one attacker successfully breaches the system.

Hence, the cumulative score after *n* weeks represents the **final position** of a one-dimensional random walk after *n* steps.  
As in the classical random walk, each trajectory starts at zero and moves up or down depending on the weekly result.

## Probability Model

Let us define the probability that the server stays secure during a given week.

Each attacker has an independent probability *p* of breaching the server, so the probability that **no** attacker succeeds is:

\[
P(\text{secure}) = (1 - p)^m
\]

Consequently, the probability that the system **is breached** in a given week is:

\[
P(\text{breach}) = 1 - (1 - p)^m
\]

Each week can therefore be modeled as a **Bernoulli trial** with:
- Success probability = \( (1 - p)^m \)
- Failure probability = \( 1 - (1 - p)^m \)

## Simulation Description

In the simulation, multiple independent trajectories are generated over *n* weeks.  
For each trajectory:
1. We iterate over every week.  
2. We check whether a breach occurs, using the above probability model.  
3. We assign +1 for a secure week and −1 for a breached week.  
4. We keep track of the cumulative total score.

After many repetitions (for example, 5000 simulations), we collect the **final total scores** of all trajectories and analyze their empirical distribution.

This figure shows a comparison between the theoretical probabilities of a secure and breached week versus the empirical frequencies obtained from the simulation. The close match between the two sets of bars confirms that the simulation accurately reflects the expected probabilistic model, validating the correctness of our Bernoulli trial implementation.

## Empirical vs. Theoretical Distribution

The empirical results can be compared to the **Binomial distribution**, because each week behaves as a Bernoulli trial with two possible outcomes.  

Let *X* be the number of secure weeks during the *n* weeks. Then:

\[
X \sim \text{Binomial}(n, (1 - p)^m)
\]

The total score *S* can be derived as:

\[
S = (+1) \times X + (-1) \times (n - X) = 2X - n
\]

This transformation links the **binomial distribution** of *X* to the **distribution of total scores** in the random walk.

The figure compares the empirical distribution of the total scores obtained from the simulation (red bars) with the theoretical distribution predicted by the binomial model (blue line). The close match between the two illustrates how the random walk of secure vs. insecure weeks follows the expected binomial behavior after the transformation

When we plot the frequencies of the final total scores obtained from the simulation and overlay the theoretical binomial probabilities, we can observe how the two distributions converge as *n* and *m* grow.

## Convergence Analysis

As the number of weeks (*n*) and the number of attackers (*m*) increase:
- The empirical distribution of total scores approaches the theoretical binomial curve.
- The random walk analogy becomes stronger and more stable.
- According to the **Central Limit Theorem**, the distribution of total scores tends toward a **normal (Gaussian) distribution**.

This demonstrates that the stochastic process describing the server’s security status behaves like a random walk whose limiting distribution converges to a normal form when the system size is large.

## Conclusion

This experiment illustrates how a system exposed to probabilistic breaches can be modeled as a discrete random walk, where the overall stability of the server over time depends on the balance between secure and breached weeks.  

The comparison between simulation outcomes and the binomial distribution highlights the fundamental connection between random walks, Bernoulli trials, and probability convergence.  
As *n* and *m* increase, the results show a clear tendency toward the theoretical model, confirming the expected probabilistic behavior.
