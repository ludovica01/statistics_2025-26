<h2>Objective</h2>

Today we will use the **stochastic differential equation (SDE) simulator** developed in previous assignments (based on the **Euler–Maruyama method**) to simulate a **Wiener process** (Brownian motion).

Optionally, the program is generalized so that it can handle more general stochastic differential equations of the form

<em>X<sub>n+1</sub>​=X<sub>n​</sub>+a(X<sub>n</sub>​,t<sub>n</sub>​)Δt+b(X<sub>n</sub>​,t<sub>n</sub>​)ΔW<sub>n</sub>​</em>

where <em>W<sub>t</sub></em> is a Wiener process.

<h2>Theoretical Background</h2>

<p>
- **Wiener Process (Brownian Motion)** W<sub>t</sub>: a stochastic process such that:
  - <em>W<sub>0</sub> = 0</em>,
  - it has independent increments,
  - the increments are normally distributed with mean 0 and variance <em>t - s</em> over any interval <em>[s, t]</em>.

  In discrete time with step size Δ<sub>t</sub>, the increments are:

<em>ΔW<sub>n</sub>​=(radice)Δ<sub>t</sub> ​Z<sub>n</sub>​,    Z<sub>n​</sub> ∼ N(0,1)</em>

  and the process evolves as:

  <em>W<sub>n+1</sub> = W<sub>n</sub> + square_root(Δ<sub>t</sub>), Z<sub>n</sub>, Z<sub>n</sub> ​∼ N (0,1)</em>


<p>
- **Euler–Maruyama Method** for a general SDE:

<em>d X<sub>t</sub>​= a(X<sub>t</sub>​,t)dt + b (X<sub>t</sub>​,t) d W<sub>t</sub>​</em>


The numerical scheme is:

<em>X<sub>n+1</sub>​=X<sub>n</sub>​+a(X<sub></sub>n​,t<sub>n</sub>​)Δt+b(X<sub>n</sub>​,t<sub>n</sub>​)ΔW<sub>n</sub>​</em>


For the Wiener process itself, the SDE is simply:


<em>d W<sub>t</sub>​=d W<sub>t</sub>​,    W<sub>0</sub> ​= 0</em>



<h2>Simulation Results</h2>

<h3>Single Wiener Process</h3>
This figure shows a single realization of a Wiener process (Brownian motion) simulated using the Euler–Maruyama method.  
The trajectory starts from zero and evolves with random fluctuations driven by Gaussian noise.  
The irregular and nowhere-differentiable behavior is a fundamental property of Brownian motion.  
The variance of the process increases over time, reflecting the theoretical property <em>Var(W(t)) = t</em>.

<h3>Multiple Wiener Process Realizations</h3>
This plot displays multiple independent realizations of the Wiener process generated with the same numerical method.  
Each trajectory follows a different random path, even though all share the same statistical properties.  
This clearly illustrates the stochastic nature of Brownian motion and the concept of independent increments.  
Despite their differences, all paths exhibit increasing dispersion over time.

<h3>Ornstein–Uhlenbeck Process (General SDE)</h3>
This figure represents the simulation of an Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process, which is a generalized stochastic differential equation.  
Unlike pure Brownian motion, this process exhibits a mean-reverting behavior toward a long-term average value.  
The balance between the deterministic drift and the stochastic diffusion produces bounded random fluctuations.  
This model is widely used in physics, biology, and financial mathematics.
