Statistical Distributions and Datasets

In statistics, a dataset is a structured collection of data, typically organized in a tabular form, where each row represents an observation (or statistical unit) and each column represents a variable describing a specific attribute of those observations. Variables can be quantitative (numerical) or qualitative (categorical), and their measurement scales—nominal, ordinal, interval, or ratio—determine the types of analysis that can be performed. Datasets are the foundation of statistical investigation, as they provide the raw information from which patterns, relationships, and inferences can be drawn. A well-constructed dataset should be accurate, complete, and representative of the population under study.

A statistical distribution describes how the values of a variable are spread or distributed within a dataset. It shows the frequency or probability of different outcomes and helps to understand the overall behavior of the data. For example, a frequency distribution lists the number of times each value occurs, while a probability distribution assigns probabilities to each possible value of a random variable. Distributions can be discrete, when the variable takes distinct values (such as the number of students in a class), or continuous, when the variable can assume any value within an interval (such as height or temperature).

Understanding the shape of a distribution—whether it is symmetric, skewed, or has multiple peaks—is essential for statistical analysis. Common theoretical models, like the normal distribution, binomial distribution, and Poisson distribution, provide mathematical frameworks to describe real-world phenomena. These models allow researchers to make predictions, estimate parameters, and test hypotheses. In essence, datasets provide the empirical basis of statistical work, while distributions offer the conceptual tools to interpret and generalize from the data.


Case Study Description: Analysis of Preferences on Streaming Platforms

Objective of the Analysis

The goal of this project is to analyze a small data sample to describe user preferences across different streaming platforms. Using a custom-created dataset, the analysis aims to explore how genre preferences and service ratings are distributed among the main platforms.

Dataset Context and Attributes

We have simulated data collection from 15 users, recording three key pieces of information for each. These three attributes (or statistical variables) form the columns of our dataset:

- Platform: Indicates the streaming service used by the user.

 1. Type: Qualitative Variable.

2. Scale of Measurement: Nominal, as the categories ('Netflix', 'Prime Video', 'Disney+') have no intrinsic order.

- Preferred Genre: Represents the user's favorite content genre.

1. Type: Qualitative Variable.

2. Scale of Measurement: Nominal, since the genres ('Action', 'Comedy', 'Drama') do not follow a predefined order.

- Service Rating: Expresses the user's judgment of the platform's quality.

1. Type: Qualitative Variable.

2. Scale of Measurement: Ordinal, because the modalities ('Low', 'Medium', 'High') represent a hierarchical order of satisfaction.

The set of 15 records forms our data matrix, where each row represents a statistical unit (the user).

The work was carried out following a precise methodological procedure, using a database management system (DBMS) to ensure data integrity and analysis.

- Database Setup: PostgreSQL was used as the DBMS. A table named streaming_preferences was created to host the dataset. The table structure was defined using the CREATE TABLE command, specifying the names and data types for the three attributes and a primary key (id).

- Data Insertion: The table was populated with 15 sample records using the INSERT INTO command. This step transformed the empty structure into a concrete and analyzable statistical dataset.

- Frequency Distribution Calculation: To meet the exercise's requirement, the trivariate distribution (or k-variate, with k=3) of absolute frequencies was calculated. An SQL query was executed with the following logic:

1. SELECT: To specify the three columns of interest (platform, preferred_genre, service_rating).

2. COUNT(*): To count the occurrences of each group.

3. GROUP BY: To group the rows that share the same unique combination of the three attributes.

- Results Visualization: The query produced a joint frequency table as its result, which shows exactly how many times each combination (e.g., "a Netflix user who prefers the Drama genre and rates the service as High") appears in our data sample. This final output represents the main result of the descriptive analysis.
