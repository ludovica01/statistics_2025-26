**Statistics** is the branch of mathematics that focuses on collecting, analyzing, interpreting, and presenting data. It provides methods and tools that help us understand patterns, relationships, and trends hidden in large datasets.

In the context of **cybersecurity**, statistics can be extremely valuable because modern security systems generate enormous amounts of data—such as network traffic, user behavior, and system logs. By applying statistical methods, cybersecurity professionals can:

1. **Detect anomalies** – Identify unusual patterns in network traffic that might indicate an intrusion or attack.  
2. **Assess risk** – Estimate the likelihood of certain threats or vulnerabilities based on historical data.  
3. **Support decision-making** – Use quantitative evidence to prioritize security investments or response strategies.  
4. **Improve machine learning models** – Many detection systems rely on statistical foundations for training and evaluation.

In short, statistics turns raw data into actionable insights, helping cybersecurity experts move from reactive to proactive defense strategies.
