# Deriving Simple Recurrence Formulas for Mean and Variance

When processing data streams or large datasets, recalculating the mean and variance from scratch for every new observation ($X_n$) is computationally inefficient. Instead, we can use **recurrence (or online) formulas** that update the statistics based only on the previous statistics (for $n-1$ observations) and the new observation. This approach simplifies the process considerably and is often essential in real-time applications.

## 1. Recursive Formula for the Mean ($\bar{X}_n$)

The mean of $n$ observations ($\bar{X}_n$) is defined as:

$$ \bar{X}_n = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^{n} X_i $$

We can separate the sum into the first $n-1$ elements and the $n$-th element ($X_n$):

$$ \bar{X}_n = \frac{1}{n} \left( \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} X_i + X_n \right) $$

We know that the sum of the first $n-1$ elements is equal to $(n-1)$ times the previous mean ($\bar{X}_{n-1}$):

$$ \sum_{i=1}^{n-1} X_i = (n-1) \bar{X}_{n-1} $$

Substituting this back into the formula for $\bar{X}_n$:

$$ \bar{X}_n = \frac{1}{n} \left( (n-1) \bar{X}_{n-1} + X_n \right) $$

To simplify, we can rewrite $(n-1)/n$ as $1 - 1/n$:

$$ \bar{X}_n = \left( 1 - \frac{1}{n} \right) \bar{X}_{n-1} + \frac{1}{n} X_n $$

Alternatively, a very simple and numerically stable recursive update can be derived by calculating the difference (or error) caused by the new observation:

$$ \bar{X}_n = \bar{X}_{n-1} + \frac{X_n - \bar{X}_{n-1}}{n} $$

**This final formula is the simplest recurrence relation for the mean.** The term $ (X_n - \bar{X}_{n-1}) $ is the error, which is then corrected by distributing it across all $n$ observations.

## 2. Recursive Formula for the Variance ($V_n$)

The variance is typically calculated using the sum of squared differences from the mean. Let $S_n$ be the sum of squared differences for $n$ observations:

$$ S_n = \sum_{i=1}^{n} (X_i - \bar{X}_n)^2 $$

For recursive calculation, we focus on how $S_n$ relates to $S_{n-1}$ and the new data point $X_n$. This derivation often follows **Welford’s method** to maintain numerical stability.

Let $S_{n-1}$ be the previous sum of squared differences. The new sum $S_n$ can be related to $S_{n-1}$ using the following update, which incorporates the previous mean ($\bar{X}_{n-1}$) and the new mean ($\bar{X}_n$):

$$ S_n = S_{n-1} + (X_n - \bar{X}_{n-1})(X_n - \bar{X}_n) $$

While the term $(X_n - \bar{X}_n)$ can be complex to calculate recursively, we can substitute the mean update formula ($\bar{X}_n = \bar{X}_{n-1} + \delta_n / n$, where $\delta_n = X_n - \bar{X}_{n-1}$ is the error):

$$ S_n = S_{n-1} + \delta_n \left( \delta_n - \frac{\delta_n}{n} \right) $$

Simplifying this leads to the **recurrence formula for the sum of squared differences**:

$$ S_n = S_{n-1} + \frac{n-1}{n} (X_n - \bar{X}_{n-1})^2 $$

Once $S_n$ is calculated, the sample variance $V_n$ is obtained by dividing by $n-1$ (for $n>1$):

$$ V_n = \frac{S_n}{n-1} $$

## 3. Example Code Implementation

The following Python code demonstrates the use of these recurrence formulas to calculate the mean and variance sequentially as new data arrives. This implements a stable, single-pass algorithm often used in data streaming environments.

```python
import random

def calculate_online_statistics(data_stream):
    """
    Calculates the mean and variance recursively (online method).
    Uses the formulas derived above for computational efficiency.
    """
    n = 0
    mean = 0.0
    M2 = 0.0  # M2 is the sum of squares of differences (S_n)

    for x in data_stream:
        n += 1

        if n == 1:
            mean = x
            M2 = 0.0
        else:
            # 1. Update Mean (Recurrence Formula: X_bar_n = X_bar_(n-1) + (X_n - X_bar_(n-1)) / n)
            delta = x - mean
            mean += delta / n

            # 2. Update Sum of Squared Differences (Recurrence Formula for S_n)
            # This is the Welford update optimized for stability:
            delta2 = x - mean
            M2 += delta * delta2

    variance = M2 / (n - 1) if n > 1 else 0.0
    
    return mean, variance, n

# Example usage with random data
data = [random.randint(1, 100) for _ in range(10)]
final_mean, final_variance, total_count = calculate_online_statistics(data)

print(f"Data Stream: {data}")
print(f"Total Observations (n): {total_count}")
print(f"Online Mean: {final_mean:.4f}")
print(f"Online Variance: {final_variance:.4f}")

# Compare with built-in functions (using numpy for comparison only)
try:
    import numpy as np
    np_mean = np.mean(data)
    np_variance = np.var(data, ddof=1) # ddof=1 for sample variance
    print("\n--- Verification (Numpy) ---")
    print(f"Numpy Mean: {np_mean:.4f}")
    print(f"Numpy Sample Variance: {np_variance:.4f}")
except ImportError:
    pass
