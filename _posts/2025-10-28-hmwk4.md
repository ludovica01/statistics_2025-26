<h2>Objective</h2>

Simulate the Law of Large Numbers (LLN) by plotting multiple trajectories of the running relative frequency \(f_k\) for Bernoulli trials. Show how, as the number of trials \(n\) grows, the empirical distribution of final relative frequencies \(f_n\) (over all simulated trajectories) concentrates around the underlying success probability \(p\).

<h2>Short description of the procedure</h2>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Model:</strong> i.i.d. Bernoulli trials with success probability <code>p</code>.</li>
  <li><strong>Simulation:</strong> generate <code>m</code> independent trajectories, each consisting of <code>n</code> trials; for each trajectory compute the running relative frequency <code>f_k</code> = (#successes up to k)/k.</li>
  <li><strong>Visualization:</strong> plot all <code>m</code> trajectories of <code>f_k</code> (main chart) and display a vertical histogram on the right that shows the empirical distribution of <code>f_n</code> across the trajectories.</li>
  <li><strong>Interpretation:</strong> as <code>n</code> increases the histogram tightens around <code>p</code>, illustrating LLN.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Results</h2>

<p>All images were generated by running a Colab notebook that simulates the experiment and saves PNGs. The files are available in the repository under <code>css/images/</code> (adjust paths if you use a different folder).</p>

<h4>Trajectories with right-side histogram</h4>
<p>
The main plot shows <em>m</em> trajectories of the running relative frequency <code>f_k</code> (transparent blue lines),
the black line indicates the average across trajectories, and the dashed red line marks the true probability <code>p</code>.
The orange vertical histogram on the right displays the empirical distribution of final frequencies <code>f_n</code>.

<h4>Standalone histogram of final frequencies</h4>
<p>
This histogram isolates the distribution of the final relative frequencies <code>f_n</code> across all <code>m</code> trajectories.
As <code>n</code> becomes large, the histogram concentrates around the true value of <code>p</code>, which visually demonstrates the Law of Large Numbers.

<h2>Files and data</h2>

<p>
Here you can see the final relative frequencies for the text we anylized. Each value in this file represents the relative frequency <code>f(n)</code> obtained at the end of a simulated trajectory.  
These frequencies show how, as the number of trials increases, the empirical results converge toward the true probability of success <code>p</code>, illustrating the Law of Large Numbers in practice.

<h2>Short interpretation</h2>

<p>
The plots illustrate the Law of Large Numbers: even though individual trajectories fluctuate, their average converges to the true probability <code>p</code>, and the distribution of final relative frequencies tightens around <code>p</code> as the number of trials <code>n</code> increases. The right-side histogram makes this concentration immediately visible.
